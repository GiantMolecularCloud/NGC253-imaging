## Abstract

We present 0.15" (∼2.5 pc) resolution ALMA CO(3-2) observations of the starbursting center in NGC 253. Together with archival ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) data, we decompose the emission into disk and nondisk components. We find ∼7%-16% of the CO luminosity to be associated with the nondisk component (1.2-4.2×10^7 K km s-1 pc2). The total molecular gas mass in the center of NGC 253 is ∼3.6×10^8 M☉ with ∼0.5×10^8 M☉ (∼15%) in the nondisk component. These measurements are consistent across independent mass estimates through three CO transitions. The high-resolution CO(3-2) observations allow us to identify the molecular outflow within the nondisk gas. Using a starburst conversion factor, we estimate the deprojected molecular mass outflow rate, kinetic energy, and momentum in the starburst of NGC 253. The deprojected molecular mass outflow rate is in the range of ∼14-39 M ☉ yr-1 with an uncertainty of 0.4 dex. The large spread arises due to different interpretations of the kinematics of the observed gas while the errors are due to unknown geometry. The majority of this outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows perpendicular to the disk, with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas. This results in a mass-loading factor η ={\dot{M}}out}/{\dot{M}}SFR} in the range η ∼ 8-20 for gas ejected out to ∼300 pc. We find the kinetic energy of the outflow to be ∼2.5-4.5×1054 erg and a typical error of ∼0.8 dex, which is ∼0.1% of the total or ∼8% of the kinetic energy supplied by the starburst. The outflow momentum is 4.8-8.7×10^8 M ☉ km s-1 (∼0.5 dex error) or ∼2.5%-4% of the kinetic momentum released into the ISM by the feedback. The unknown outflow geometry and launching sites are the primary sources of uncertainty in this study.


## Disclaimer

Note that is this should not be understood as a pipeline to automatically reproduce the results of this publication.
Changes during the analysis and interactive steps may prevent these scripts from running unsupervised.
Instead, they should allow to understand technical aspects of the analysis and retrace it, e.g. to test consistency with future analyses.
Scripts may make intransparent use of convenience functions, such as my [python_helpers](https://github.com/GiantMolecularCloud/python_helpers).
These may be loaded in a python startup file which is not apparent from the scripts.
Also, software versions may not be given. For example, some code may break when run in python3 because it was developed in python2 back then. This applies equivalently for other software packages.
Personal information such as file paths are edited out which may break cross-references between scripts.
Note that many python scripts are actually CASA scripts and require certain packages such as astropy to be installed within CASA.
